# automated-milestones

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that allows milestones (created in gitub) to be closed automatically via a git commit message.

## How
Writing `completes m_id`  (id being the milestone number) within a commit message, will automatically close a milestone and add a reference to that commit within the milestone description. The status of the commit will be modified, creating a direct link to the milestone under `Details`.
