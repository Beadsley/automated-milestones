# automated-milestones

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that allows milestones to be closed automatically via a git commit message. Milestones can also be visually accessed, an example can be found under the following [GitHub Pages](https://beadsley.github.io/automated-milestones/)

## How
> Writing `completes m_id` (id being the milestone number) within a commit message, will automatically close a milestone and add a reference to that commit within the milestone description. The status of the commit will be modified, creating a direct link to the milestone under `Details`. An example can be found under the commit history of the branch [example](https://github.com/Beadsley/automated-milestones/commits/example). Click on the status of the last commit.
